# Blinket Gap Filler 🛍️

This is a hackathon project that supports local campus shopkeepers by showcasing items **not available on Blinkit**, but available inside our campus.

## 💡 Problem

Due to Blinkit delivery being widely available, students are ignoring local shops inside the campus. This is reducing their sales even though they offer unique and essential products.

## ✅ Solution

Our website helps:
- Highlight products that **are not on Blinkit**
- Promote **in-campus shops**
- Allow students to discover what’s available nearby

## 📁 Features

- 🛒 Student Login Page
- 🏠 Homepage to browse local shop products
- 🔍 Filter products not available on Blinkit
- 📍 Shop location (optional)
- 🧑‍💻 Admin/Shopkeeper panel (future enhancement)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Golang
- **Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL (TBD)
